## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### DAX Calculations

**Rural Cost Adjustment:**
```dax
Rural_adjusted_cost = 
    infrastructure_cost[unit_cost_USD] * 1.5
```

**Budgeted Improvement Cost:**
```dax
Budgeted_improvement_cost =
IF(
    'project_progress'[location_type] == "Rural",
    RELATED('infrastructure_cost'[Rural_adjusted_cost]),
    RELATED('infrastructure_cost'[unit_cost_USD])
)
```

**Average Queue Time:**
```dax
Average_queue_time =
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('visits'[time_in_queue]),
    FILTER(
        'visits',
        'visits'[source_id] = 'water_source'[source_id]
    )
)
```

**Basic Water Access Classification:**
```dax
Basic_water_access =
IF(
    AND(
        'water_source'[type_of_water_source] = "well",
        RELATED('well_pollution'[results]) = "Clean"
    ),
    "Basic Access",
    IF(
        'water_source'[type_of_water_source] = "tap_in_home",
        "Basic Access",
        IF(
            AND(
                'water_source'[type_of_water_source] = "shared_tap",
                'water_source'[Average_queue_time] < 30
            ),
            "Basic Access",
            "Below Basic Access"
        )
    )
)
```

**Improvement Type Aggregation:**
```dax
Aggregated_improvements =
IF(
    CONTAINSSTRING(
        'project_progress'[improvement], "Install"
    ),
    "Install public tap(s)*",
    IF(
        'project_progress'[improvement] == "Diagnose local infrastructure",
        "Repair infrastructure",
        'project_progress'[improvement]
    )
)
```

### Data Model
- **Fact Table:** project_progress (improvement records)
- **Dimension Tables:** 
  - water_source (source details and classification)
  - infrastructure_cost (unit costs and rural adjustments)
  - location (province and town information)
  - well_pollution (water quality data)
  - visits (queue time and survey data)

### Interactive Features
- **Bookmarks:** Toggle between Province and Improvement budget views
- **Drill-Through:** Click provinces on national view to access detailed provincial reports
- **Slicers:** Province selection with map visualization
- **Custom Buttons:** Toggle between different data perspectives

## 📈 Water Access Classification (UN Standards)

| Service Level | Definition |
|---------------|------------|
| **Safely Managed** | Accessible on premises, available when needed, free from contamination |
| **Basic** | Collection time ≤ 30 minutes for round trip including queuing |
| **Limited** | Collection time > 30 minutes for round trip including queuing |
| **Unimproved** | Unprotected dug well or unprotected spring |
| **Surface Water** | Directly from river, dam, lake, pond, stream, canal, or irrigation canal |

## 🎨 Visualization Guidelines

- **Minimal Formatting:** Clean design focused on data clarity
- **Consistent Color Scheme:** Professional color palette across all visuals

## 📚 Methodology

This project follows a user-story driven approach:

**President Naledi's Requirements:**
1. See key survey results for overall water access status
2. Understand how many people are affected and their challenges
3. Know total budget needed and spending breakdown
4. View data at both national and provincial levels

**Provincial Leaders' Requirements:**
1. Province-specific population served by water source type
2. Number of sources by type and location (rural/urban)
3. Town-level statistics and relevant provincial data
4. Summary of improvements and associated costs

## 🏆 Impact

This dashboard enables:
- **Strategic Planning:** Evidence-based budget allocation across provinces
- **Accountability:** Clear tracking of improvement types and costs
- **Progress Monitoring:** Baseline measurement (34% access) for future impact assessment
- **Localized Decision-Making:** Provincial leaders can prioritize town-level interventions
