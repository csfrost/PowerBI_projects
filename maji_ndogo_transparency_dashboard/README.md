## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Model Architecture
- **Star Schema Design**: Central fact table (project_progress) with related dimension tables
- **Dimension Tables**: location, water_source, infrastructure_cost, vendors, well_pollution
- **Optimized Relationships**: One-to-many with proper bi-directional filtering where needed
- **Calculated Columns**: Rural cost adjustments, improvement classifications, aggregated types

### Advanced DAX Measures

**Project Progress Metrics**:
```dax
total_improvements = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS('project_progress'),
        ALLEXCEPT('project_progress', 'project_progress'[town])
    )

number_completed_projects = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS('project_progress'),
        'project_progress'[source_status] = "Complete"
    )

pct_project_complete = 
    DIVIDE([number_completed_projects], [total_improvements], 0)
```

**Budget Tracking with Time Intelligence**:
```dax
cumulative_budget = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('project_progress'[budgeted_improvement_cost]),
        FILTER(
            ALL('project_progress'[date_of_completion]),
            'project_progress'[date_of_completion] <= MAX('project_progress'[date_of_completion]) &&
            NOT(ISBLANK('project_progress'[date_of_completion]))
        )
    )

cumulative_cost = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('project_progress'[cost]),
        FILTER(
            ALL('project_progress'[date_of_completion]),
            'project_progress'[date_of_completion] <= MAX('project_progress'[date_of_completion]) &&
            NOT(ISBLANK('project_progress'[date_of_completion]))
        )
    )
```

**Population Impact Analysis**:
```dax
total_population = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('water_source'[number_of_people_served]),
        ALLEXCEPT('project_progress', 'project_progress'[town])
    )

population_with_basic_access = 
    CALCULATE(
        SUM('water_source'[number_of_people_served]),
        FILTER(
            ALL(water_source),
            OR(
                OR(
                    AND(
                        'water_source'[type_of_water_source] = "well",
                        RELATED(well_pollution[results]) = "Clean"
                    ),
                    'water_source'[type_of_water_source] = "tap_in_home"
                ),
                AND(
                    'water_source'[type_of_water_source] = "shared_tap",
                    'water_source'[Average_queue_time] < 30
                )
            )
        )
    )

pct_population_now_basic_access = 
    DIVIDE(
        [population_with_basic_access] + [population_now_basic_access],
        [total_population],
        0
    )
```

- Excessive travel between distant job sites
- Completed fewer projects (312)

### 4. Optimization Recommendations
✅ Created vendor training materials on optimal job selection  
✅ Encouraged proximity-based assignment strategies  
✅ Implemented routing optimization guidelines
